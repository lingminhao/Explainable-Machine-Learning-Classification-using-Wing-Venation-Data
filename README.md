# Explainable Machine Learning Classification of Forensically Important Flies using Wing Venation Data

This project is still at its early stage and thus any results or codes couldn't be open-sourced due to university copyrights policy. But I will give a brief description of my project here. 

For a detailed description of the project, refer to ![proposal](https://github.com/lingminhao/Explainable-Machine-Learning-Classification-using-Wing-Venation-Data/blob/main/Project%20Proposal.pdf)

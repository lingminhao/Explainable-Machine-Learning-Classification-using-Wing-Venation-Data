# Explainable Machine Learning Classification of Forensically Important Flies using Wing Venation Data

This project is still at its early stage and thus the results are still in progress and incomplete. For those who are intersted, refer to my research proposal [here](https://github.com/lingminhao/Explainable-Machine-Learning-Classification-using-Wing-Venation-Data/blob/main/Project%20Proposal.pdf).
